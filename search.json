    "text": "Course overview\nIn this introductory course to Analytical Palaeobiology attendees will be provided with an extensive guide to the theory behind it, and tools available for getting started with reconstructing deep-time macroecological and macroevolutionary patterns.\nFirst, key concepts such as the structure of the fossil record and associated geological and anthropogenic biases will be introduced, followed by the type of data and databases available for reconstructing deep-time biodiversity trends. Subsequently, we will introduce various tools available within the R environment for modelling deep-time macroecological and macroevolutionary patterns, and testing hypotheses.\nR is one of the most popular languages in the world of Data Science and has been widely adopted by the paleobiological community to clean, analyse and plot data.\nThis course will provide an extensive introduction to palaeoverse, an R package that supports data preparation and exploration for paleobiological analysis. Additional packages developed by Palaeoverse, such as rmacrostrat, will also be introduced along with the versatility R has to offer.\nThis course will provide an opportunity for attendees to work with different researchers and gain experience working collaboratively in R to generate reproducible research.\nParticipants are encouraged to bring their dataset (but not required), as the schedule will include time for applying the tools presented in the workshop to their research questions.\n\n\nIntended audience and assumed background\nThis course is addressed to any palaeobiologist interested in learning tools to develop their analysis.\nBasic knowledge of R is required to follow the course.\n\n\nDates and schedule\nOnline live sessions on November 25th–29th, 2024.\nFrom 14:00 to 18:00 (Madrid time zone). See schedule.\nTotal course hours: 20.\n\n\nFormat\nIn the live sessions we will combine online lectures with hands-on computational exercises, in R. Participants are encouraged to bring their dataset (but not required), as the schedule will include time for applying the tools presented in the course to their research questions.\nLive sessions will be recorded. However, attendance to the live sessions is required to obtain the course certificate.",

    "text": "Meet your course instructors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis A. Jones, University College London\nI am a Computational Palaeobiologist examining the macroecological and macroevolutionary history of reef-building organisms through the integration of interdisciplinary tools and diverse sources of information, such as ecological modelling, Earth System modelling, and fossil and extant occurrence datasets. An additional significant theme of my research is the evaluation of the influence of data incompleteness on perceptions of the geological past, such as biodiversity trends. I also work on developing software tools and resources for the palaeobiological community with the aim of improving research reproducibility in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher D. Dean, University College London\nMy research focuses mainly on the human and geological factors that impact the quality of the fossil record and how these in turn may impact our view and understanding of macroecology in deep time. In particular, I am interested in how these biases are expressed across geographic space. I am currently working on applying the ecological technique of occupancy modelling to the mammalian fossil record of the last 1 million years in order to better understand patterns in extinction selectivity and range size change, as well as to provide relative biodiversity baselines for conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Alessandro Chiarenza, University College London\nI am a palaeontologist specialising in dinosaur palaeobiology, macroevolution, macroecology, and extinction. Using phylogenetic, biogeographic, statistical, and Earth System Modeling tools, my research focuses on:\n\nUntangling physical agents biasing the fossil record to detect genuine biodiversity signals\nUnderstanding the interplay between climate change, geography, and biodiversity in macroevolution\nInvestigating the physical drivers of evolutionary adaptations and extinction",
